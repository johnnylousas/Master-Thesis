In particular, the paper develops variants of the Barnes-Hut algorithm and of the dual-tree algorithm that approximate the gradient used for learning t-SNE embeddings in O(N log N). Our experiments show that the resulting algorithms substantially accelerate t-SNE, and that they make it possible to learn embeddings of data sets with millions of objects. Somewhat counterintuitively, the Barnes-Hut variant of t-SNE appears to outperform the dual-tree variant.},

	abstract="Modern technologies allow large, complex biomedical datasets to be collected from patient cohorts. These datasets are comprised of both continuous and categorical data (``Mixed Data''), and essential variables may be unobserved in this data due to the complex nature of biomedical phenomena. Causal inference algorithms can identify important relationships from biomedical data; however, handling the challenges of causal inference over mixed data with unmeasured confounders in a scalable way is still an open problem. Despite recent advances into causal discovery strategies that could potentially handle these challenges; individually, no study currently exists that comprehensively compares these approaches in this setting. In this paper, we present a comparative study that addresses this problem by comparing the accuracy and efficiency of different strategies in large, mixed datasets with latent confounders. We experiment with two extensions of the Fast Causal Inference algorithm: a maximum probability search procedure we recently developed to identify causal orientations more accurately, and a strategy which quickly eliminates unlikely adjacencies in order to achieve scalability to high-dimensional data. We demonstrate that these methods significantly outperform the state of the art in the field by achieving both accurate edge orientations and tractable running time in simulation experiments on datasets with up to 500 variables. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of the best performing approach on real data by applying it to a biomedical dataset of HIV-infected individuals.",

One common goal is fault detection, in which test cases that have a higher chance of detecting a fault are executed first than the remaining test cases. The goal of this study is to investigate TCP empirical studies in order to synthesize reported effectiveness results and provide a basis for future research. We conducted a systematic literature mapping to characterize TCP empirical studies and a systematic literature review to analyze reported TCP techniques effectiveness results. Among selected studies from 1999 to 2016, we found that there is a high amount of empirical studies evaluating many TCP techniques. However, when we applied our quality assessment criteria, most of them were discarded, indicating that they might have methodological problems. Analyzed studies reported results of coverage-based TCP techniques. Furthermore, we found that some context factors regarding faults, test cases of the application being tested and coverage granularity considered by TCP techniques may significantly affect the effectiveness of their execution. These results suggest that more rigorous empirical methodology is needed when evaluating TCP techniques and also, authors need to compare effectiveness results of their proposed TCP techniques with well established techniques to generate more evidences Furthermore, our analysis of significant factors on TCP techniques effectiveness can guide researchers when planning empirical evaluations and help them choosing features to compose new techniques.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 31st Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering}, pages = {34–43}, numpages = {10}, keywords = {software testing, Regression testing, systematic literature mapping, systematic literature review}, location = {Fortaleza, CE, Brazil}, series = {SBES'17} }
